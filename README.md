<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## _About The Project_

The aim of this project is to share the resume template that I've perfected over the years. 
Check-out Your_Name_Resume.pdf if you are in a hurry. And for all the folks still game, lets GOOO. 

## _What you need to do_ 

Now that you are already here, What's NEXT? \
Don't worry, I got you.
  
First things first - If you have never used LaTeX editors, create an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account. It's free and easy to start with. If you already have a LaTeX Editor, you can directly import the .zip folder and start working on your resume. 

For the folks, who just created their [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account, read on. Next Steps:
 1. Open your Overleaf account and go to Homepage 
 2. Click on New Project
 3. Click on Upload Project

 3. Drag and drop the .zip folder that you found in this Repo
 4. Voila, you are all set

## _Resume Tips to keep in mind_

Some points to consider while writing or updating your resume:
* 1 page resume is really enough for students and people with under 6-7 years of experience
* Add the Programming Languages or SW APIs used in a project just beside the Project Name. This adds more number of key-words to your resume without using any extra lines
* Always put the Sections that you like to be Highlighted or are very confident about in the top-half of your resume. E.g. students with more projects than work-experience may find it helpful to put the Projects Section above Work-experience Section
* Project names should be intuitive and reviewers/recruiters should get the gist by just looking at those names
* Use Action words in the Project Descriptions. Take a look at the [Resume Tool-kit](https://viterbicareers.usc.edu/toolkit-resume/) provided by my university USC (#Fight-On) 
* Don't include tables in your resume, it MIGHT get rejected by SW without being reviewed

## _Acknowledgment_
The first draft of this template was shared by my friend Shahwaz Khan 2+years ago and I am happy that he did. 

## _Contact_
I try to share new job listings that I come across on LinkedIn. If that interests you connect with me on LinkedIn.
